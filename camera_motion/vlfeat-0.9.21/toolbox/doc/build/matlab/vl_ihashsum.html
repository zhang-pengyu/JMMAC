[H,ID,NEXT] = <a href="%pathto:vl_ihashsum;">VL_IHASHSUM</a>(H,ID,NEXT,K,X) counts the number of
occurences of the columns of X, accumulating these to the hash
table represented by the tripled H,ID,NEXT.
</p><p>
X is a D x N array of class UINT8 each row of which defines an D
dimensional label. Labels cannot be all zeros.
</p><p>
H and NEXT are 1 x C arrays of class UINT32 and ID is a D x C
array of class UINT8. H is a vector of counts, ID stores, for each
element of H, the corresponding label, and NEXT is a vector of
indexes.
</p><p>
Once constructed, the hash table can be searched by means of the
<a href="%pathto:vl_ihashfind;">VL_IHASHFIND</a>() function.
</p><p>
The hash table uses double hashing [1] with an initial size equal
to K (so that C &gt;= K). Given a label X, this is first hashed by
using the FNV algorithm [2] to one of K bucket. If this bucket is
free, it is assigned to label X and the count is incremented.  If
the bucket is already assigned to the same label X, the count is
incremented. If the bucket is already assigned to a different
label, a second hash is used to scan (probe) the table for a free
bucket.
</p><p>
If no free/matching bucket is found (because the hash table is
full) an overflow area containing extra buckets is used. This is
visited by reading off indexe from the NEXT vector, until a
matching bucket is found or the overflow area is enlarged.

Example
</dt><dd><p>
The following example counts integer bi-dimensional label
occurences:
</p><pre>
  K = 5 ;
  h = zeros(1,K,'uint32') ;
  id = zeros(2,K,'uint8');
  next = zeros(1,K,'uint32') ;
  X = uint8([1 1 ; 1 2 ; 2 1 ; 1 1]') ;
  [h,id,next] = vl_ihashsum(h,id,next,K,X) ;
</pre><p>
resulting in
</p><pre>
  h = [1 0 1 2 0]
  id = [1    0    2    1    0
        2    0    1    1    0]
  next = [0 0 0 0 0]
</pre><p>
For example, [1;2] has a count of 1 and [1;1] has a count of
2. NEXT is zero because there have been no collisions.
