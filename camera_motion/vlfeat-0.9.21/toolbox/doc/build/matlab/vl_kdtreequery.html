[INDEX, DIST] = <a href="%pathto:vl_kdtreequery;">VL_KDTREEQUERY</a>(KDTREE, X, Y) computes the nearest
column of X to each column of Y (in Euclidean distance). KDTREE is
a forest of kd-trees build by <a href="%pathto:vl_kdtreebuild;">VL_KDTREEBUILD</a>(). X is a
NUMDIMENSIONS x NUMDATA data matrix of class SINGLE or DOUBLE with
the data indexed by the kd-trees (it must be the same data matrix
passed to VK_KDTREEBUILD() to build the trees). Y is the
NUMDIMENSIONS x NUMQUERIES matrix of query points and must have
the same class of X. INDEX is a 1 x NUMQUERIES matrix of class
UINT32 with the index of the nearest column of X for each column
of Y. DIST is a 1 x NUMQUERIES vector of class SINGLE or DOUBLE
(depending on the class of X and Y) with the corresponding squared
Euclidean distances.
</p><p>
[INDEX, DIST] = <a href="%pathto:vl_kdtreequery;">VL_KDTREEQUERY</a>(..., 'NUMNEIGHBORS', NN) can be
used to return the N nearest neighbors rather than just the
nearest one. In this case INDEX and DIST are NN x NUMQUERIES
matrices. Neighbors are returned by increasing distance.
</p><p>
<a href="%pathto:vl_kdtreequery;">VL_KDTREEQUERY</a>(..., 'MAXNUMCOMPARISONS', NCOMP) performs at most
NCOMP comparisons for each query point. In this case the result is
only approximate (i.e. approximated nearest-neighbors, or ANNs)
but the speed can be greatly improved.

Options:
</p><dl><dt>
NumNeighbors
</dt><dd><p>
Sets the number of neighbors to compute for each query point (by
default 1).
</p></dd><dt>
MaxNumComparisons
</dt><dd><p>
Sets the maximum number of comparisons per query point. The
special value 0 means unbounded. The default is 0.
