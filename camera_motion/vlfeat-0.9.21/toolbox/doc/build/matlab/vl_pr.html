[RECALL, PRECISION] = <a href="%pathto:vl_pr;">VL_PR</a>(LABELS, SCORES) computes the
precision-recall (PR) curve. LABELS are the ground truth labels,
greater than zero for a positive sample and smaller than zero for
a negative one. SCORES are the scores of the samples obtained from
a classifier, where larger scores should correspond to positive
samples.
</p><p>
Samples are ranked by decreasing scores, starting from rank 1.
PRECISION(K) and RECALL(K) are the precision and recall when
samples of rank smaller or equal to K-1 are predicted to be
positive and the remaining to be negative. So for example
PRECISION(3) is the percentage of positive samples among the two
samples with largest score. PRECISION(1) is the precision when no
samples are predicted to be positive and is conventionally set to
the value 1.
</p><p>
Set to zero the labels of samples that should be ignored in the
evaluation. Set to -INF the scores of samples which are not
retrieved. If there are samples with -INF score, then the PR curve
may have maximum recall smaller than 1, unless the INCLUDEINF
option is used (see below). The options NUMNEGATIVES and
NUMPOSITIVES can be used to add additional surrogate samples with
-INF score (see below).
</p><p>
[RECALL, PRECISION, INFO] = <a href="%pathto:vl_pr;">VL_PR</a>(...) returns an additional
structure INFO with the following fields:
</p><dl><dt>
info.auc
</dt><dd><p>
The area under the precision-recall curve. If the INTERPOLATE
option is set to FALSE, then trapezoidal interpolation is used
to integrate the PR curve. If the INTERPOLATE option is set to
TRUE, then the curve is piecewise constant and no other
approximation is introduced in the calculation of the area. In
the latter case, INFO.AUC is the same as INFO.AP.
</p></dd><dt>
info.ap
</dt><dd><p>
Average precision as defined by TREC. This is the average of the
precision observed each time a new positive sample is
recalled. In this calculation, any sample with -INF score
(unless INCLUDEINF is used) and any additional positive induced
by NUMPOSITIVES has precision equal to zero. If the INTERPOLATE
option is set to true, the AP is computed from the interpolated
precision and the result is the same as INFO.AUC. Note that AP
as defined by TREC normally does not use interpolation [1].
</p></dd><dt>
info.ap_interp_11
</dt><dd><p>
11-points interpolated average precision as defined by TREC.
This is the average of the maximum precision for recall levels
greater than 0.0, 0.1, 0.2, ..., 1.0. This measure was used in
the PASCAL VOC challenge up to the 2008 edition.
</p></dd><dt>
info.auc_pa08
</dt><dd><p>
Deprecated. It is the same of INFO.AP_INTERP_11.

<a href="%pathto:vl_pr;">VL_PR</a>(...) with no output arguments plots the PR curve in the
current axis.
</p><p>
<a href="%pathto:vl_pr;">VL_PR</a>() accepts the following options:
</p><dl><dt>
Interpolate
<span class="defaults">false</span></dt><dd><p>
If set to true, use interpolated precision. The interpolated
precision is defined as the maximum precision for a given recall
level and onwards. Here it is implemented as the cumulative
maximum from low to high scores of the precision.
</p></dd><dt>
NumPositives
<span class="defaults">[]</span></dt><dt>
NumNegatives
<span class="defaults">[]</span></dt><dd><p>
If set to a number, pretend that LABELS contains this may
positive/negative labels. NUMPOSITIVES/NUMNEGATIVES cannot be
smaller than the actual number of positive/negative entries in
LABELS. The additional positive/negative labels are appended to
the end of the sequence, as if they had -INF scores (not
retrieved). This is useful to evaluate large retrieval systems
for which one stores only a handful of top results for efficiency
reasons.
</p></dd><dt>
IncludeInf
<span class="defaults">false</span></dt><dd><p>
If set to true, data with -INF score SCORES is included in the
evaluation and the maximum recall is 1 even if -INF scores are
present. This option does not include any additional positive or
negative data introduced by specifying NUMPOSITIVES and
NUMNEGATIVES.
</p></dd><dt>
Stable
<span class="defaults">false</span></dt><dd><p>
If set to true, RECALL and PRECISION are returned in the same order
of LABELS and SCORES rather than being sorted by decreasing
score (increasing recall). Samples with -INF scores are assigned
RECALL and PRECISION equal to NaN.
</p></dd><dt>
NormalizePrior
<span class="defaults">[]</span></dt><dd><p>
If set to a scalar, reweights positive and negative labels so
that the fraction of positive ones is equal to the specified
value. This computes the normalised PR curves of [2]

About the PR curve
</dt><dd><p>
This section uses the same symbols used in the documentation of
the <a href="%pathto:vl_roc;">VL_ROC</a>() function. In addition to those quantities, define:
</p><pre>
  PRECISION(S) = TP(S) / (TP(S) + FP(S))
  RECALL(S) = TPR(S) = TP(S) / P
</pre><p>
The precision is the fraction of positive predictions which are
correct, and the recall is the fraction of positive labels that
have been correctly classified (recalled). Notice that the recall
is also equal to the true positive rate for the ROC curve (see
<a href="%pathto:vl_roc;">VL_ROC</a>()).
