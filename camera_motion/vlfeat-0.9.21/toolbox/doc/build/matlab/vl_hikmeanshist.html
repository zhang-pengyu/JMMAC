H = <a href="%pathto:vl_hikmeanshist;">VL_HIKMEANSHIST</a>(TREE,PATH) computes the histogram of the HIKM tree
nodes activated by the root-to-leaf paths PATH. PATH is usually
obtained by quantizing data by means of <a href="%pathto:vl_hikmeanspush;">VL_HIKMEANSPUSH</a>().
</p><p>
The histogram H has one bin for each node of the HIKM tree TREE.
The tree has K = TREE.K nodes and depth D = TREE.DEPTH.  Therefore
there are M = (K^(D+1) - 1) / (K - 1) nodes in the tree (not
counting the root which carries no information). Nodes are stacked
into a vector of bins in breadth first order.

The following relations illustrate the structure of PATH:
</p><pre>
  H(1)   = # of paths such that PATH(1,:) = 1
  H(K)   = # of paths such that PATH(1,:) = K
  H(K+1) = # of paths such that PATH(1:2,:) = [1 ; 1]
  H(K+K) = # of paths such that PATH(1:2,:) = [1 ; K]
