<a href="%pathto:vl_compile;">VL_COMPILE</a>() uses MEX() to compile VLFeat MEX files. This command
works only under Windows and is used to re-build problematic
binaries. The preferred method of compiling VLFeat on both UNIX
and Windows is through the provided Makefiles.
</p><p>
<a href="%pathto:vl_compile;">VL_COMPILE</a>() only compiles the MEX files and assumes that the
VLFeat DLL (i.e. the file VLFEATROOT/bin/win{32,64}/vl.dll) has
already been built. This file is built by the Makefiles.
</p><p>
By default <a href="%pathto:vl_compile;">VL_COMPILE</a>() assumes that Visual C++ is the active
MATLAB compiler. <a href="%pathto:vl_compile;">VL_COMPILE</a>('lcc') assumes that the active
compiler is LCC instead (see MEX -SETUP). Unfortunately LCC does
not seem to be able to compile the latest versions of VLFeat due
to bugs in the support of 64-bit integers. Therefore it is
recommended to use Visual C++ instead.
