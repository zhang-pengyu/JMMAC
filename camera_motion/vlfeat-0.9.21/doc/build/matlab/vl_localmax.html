SEL=<a href="%pathto:vl_localmax;">VL_LOCALMAX</a>(F) returns the indexes of the local maximizers of
the Q-dimensional array F.
</p><p>
A local maximizer is an array element whose value is larger than
the value of all its neighbors.  The neighbors of an element
i1...iQ have subscripts j1...jQ such that iq-1 &lt;= jq &lt;= iq
(excluding i1...iQ itself).  For example, if Q=1 the neighbors of
an element are its predecessor and successor in the linear order;
if Q=2, its neighbors are the elements immediately to its north,
south, west, est, north-west, north-est, south-west and south-est
(8-neighborhood).
</p><p>
Points on the boundary of F are ignored (and never selected as
local maximizers).
</p><p>
SEL=<a href="%pathto:vl_localmax;">VL_LOCALMAX</a>(F,THRESH) accepts an element as a mazimizer only
if it is not smaller than THRESH.
</p><p>
SEL=<a href="%pathto:vl_localmax;">VL_LOCALMAX</a>(F,THRESH,P) looks for neighbors only in the first
P dimensions of the Q-dimensional array F. This allows to process
F in ``slices''.

Remark
</dt><dd><p>
Matrices (2-array) with a singleton dimension are
interpreted as vectors (1-array). So for example <a href="%pathto:vl_localmax;">VL_LOCALMAX</a>([0 1
0]) and <a href="%pathto:vl_localmax;">VL_LOCALMAX</a>([0 1 0]') both return 2 as an aswer. However,
if [0 1 0] is to be interpreted as a 1x2 matrix, then the
correct answer is the empty set, as all elements are on the
boundary. Unfortunately MATLAB does not distinguish between
vectors and 2-matrices with a singleton dimension.  To forece
the interpretation of all matrices as 2-arrays, use
<a href="%pathto:vl_localmax;">VL_LOCALMAX</a>(F,TRESH,2) (but note that in this case the result is
always empty!).
