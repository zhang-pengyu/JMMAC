<a href="%pathto:vl_printsize;">VL_PRINTSIZE</a>(R) adjusts the PaperPosition property of the current
figure to make the figure paper width equal to R times the width
of a 'uslsetter' page, while preserving the aspect ratio of the
figure. Then, it sets the PaperSize property to match tightly the
size of the figure.
</p><p>
<a href="%pathto:vl_printsize;">VL_PRINTSIZE</a>(FIG,R) operates on the specified figure FIG. The
function accepts the following optional arguments:
</p><dl><dt>
AspectRatio
<span class="defaults">[]</span></dt><dd><p>
Change the figure aspect ratio (width/height) to the specified
value.
</p></dd><dt>
Reference
<span class="defaults">'horizontal'</span></dt><dd><p>
If set to 'horizontal', <a href="%pathto:vl_printsize;">VL_PRINTSIZE</a>(R) makes the width of the
figure equal to a fraction R of the width of the page. If set to
'vertical', the height is used instead.
</p></dd><dt>
PaperType
<span class="defaults">'usletter'</span></dt><dd><p>
Set the type of the reference page to the specified type. Any of
the paper types supported by MATLAB can be used (see
PRINT()).
</p></dd><dt>
Margin
<span class="defaults">0</span></dt><dd><p>
If greater than zero, <a href="%pathto:vl_printsize;">VL_PRINTSIZE</a>(R) leaves the specified
margin around the figure rather than fitting the paper size
tightly around it. The margin is expressed as a fraction of the
figure paper width (or height if Reference is set to
'vertical').

PRINTING FIGURES IN MATLAB
</p><p>
The standard procedure to include a MATLAB figure in a publication
consists in printing the figure to an EPS or PDF file (by using
the PRINT() function) and then rescaling it to the desired size in
the publication. PDF printing has the additional inconvenience
that large white margins are generated, and requires cropping the
figure too.
</p><p>
Unfortunately, rescalign a figure in this manner has the usually
unwanted effect of rescaling elements of the graphics such as font
sizes and line thicknesses. For example, a font which is 12pt in
the original MATLAB figure may become too large or too small after
rescaling.
</p><p>
The `proper' way of printing a figure is to specify its desired
size on paper before calling the PRINT() function. <a href="%pathto:vl_printsize;">VL_PRINTSIZE</a>()
helps doing so.
</p><p>
Margins are an additional nuances. When printing to certain
formats such as PDF, MATLAB prints in fact entire page (e.g. a
whole US Letter sheet), resulting in wide white margin all around
the figure. <a href="%pathto:vl_printsize;">VL_PRINTSIZE</a>() alleviates this problem by setting the
paper size to match the figure size tightly. This does not
eliminate margins completely, especially if the figure has
multiple subplots, but it is certainly a large improvement.
