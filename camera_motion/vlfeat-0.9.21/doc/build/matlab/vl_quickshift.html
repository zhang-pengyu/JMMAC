Quick shift is a mode seeking algorithm which links each pixel to
its nearest neighbor which has an increase in the estimate of the
density. These links form a tree, where the root of the tree is
the pixel which correspond to the highest mode in the image.
</p><p>
[MAP,GAPS] = <a href="%pathto:vl_quickshift;">VL_QUICKSHIFT</a>(I, KERNELSIZE, MAXDIST) computes quick shift on the
image I. KERNELSIZE is the bandwidth of the Parzen window estimator of
the density. Since searching over all pixels for the nearest
neighbor which increases the density would be prohibitively
expensive, MAXDIST controls the maximum L2 distance between neighbors
that should be linked. MAP and GAP represent the resulting forest
of trees. They are array of the same size of I.  Each element
(pixel) of MAP is and index to the parent elemen in the forest and
GAP contains the corresponding branch length. Pixels which are at
the root of their respective tree have MAP(x) = x and GAPS(x) =
inf.
</p><p>
[MAP,GAPS,E] = <a href="%pathto:vl_quickshift;">VL_QUICKSHIFT</a>(I, KERNELSIZE, MAXDIST) also returns the estimate
of the density E.
</p><p>
[MAP,GAPS] = <a href="%pathto:vl_quickshift;">VL_QUICKSHIFT</a>(I, KERNELSIZE) uses a default MAXDIST of 3 * KERNELSIZE.

Notes
</dt><dd><p>
The distance between pixels is always measured in image
coordinates (not normalized), so the importance of the color
component should be weighted accordingly before calling this
function.
