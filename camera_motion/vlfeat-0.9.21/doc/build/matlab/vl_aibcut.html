CUT = <a href="%pathto:vl_aibcut;">VL_AIBCUT</a>(PARENTS, N) cuts the binary merge tree PARENTS and
returns a cut CUT of N nodes. The format of PARENTS is the same
used by the <a href="%pathto:vl_aib;">VL_AIB</a>() function.
</p><p>
A cut is a set of N nodes such that no node is a descendant of any
other node in the cut and such that all leaves descend from a node
in the cut. The vector CUT lists the nodes of the binary merge tree
PARENT that form the cut.
</p><p>
Nodes with null parent (as defined by PARENTS) are included in the
cut if the other nodes are not enough to fill a cut of N elements.
</p><p>
[CUT, MAP] = <a href="%pathto:vl_aibcut;">VL_AIBCUT</a>(...) returns a vector MAP with the same size
as PARENTS. MAP assigns each node below or in the cut to the
corresponding element in the CUT vector (each element above the cut
or with null parent is mapped to 0). To get the index of the
corresponding cut nodes use CUT(MAP). MAP can be used to quantize
the leaves in a sequences of N contiguous indexes, starting from
one (see also <a href="%pathto:vl_aibcutpush;">VL_AIBCUTPUSH</a>()).
</p><p>
[CUT, MAP, SHORT] = <a href="%pathto:vl_aibcut;">VL_AIBCUT</a>(...) returns also a vector SHORT that
represents a version of the PARENTS tree where nodes below the cut
are short-circuitied to link to the corresponding cut ancestors
directly. Null parents are left unchanged, except if the
corresponding node is in the cut (in which case the map-to-itself
rule has the precedence).
